The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a simple two-player game built using Python's tkinter library. It features a colorful and user-friendly interface where both players can select their moves (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) using buttons.

The game follows standard rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
Once both players make their choices, the winner is instantly announced via a pop-up message, or a tie is declared. The game automatically resets after each round, allowing players to play again seamlessly.
